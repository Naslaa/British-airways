- **X-axis**: Displays input features used in the model.
- **Y-axis**: Shows the importance score of each feature.
- The taller the bar, the more important the feature is in influencing the model’s decision.

---

###  Top 3 Most Important Features:

1. **`length_of_stay`** – Most influential feature in the dataset.
2. **`flight_duration`** – Very closely ranked to `length_of_stay`.
